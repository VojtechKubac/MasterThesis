# MasterThesis
Fluid-Structure Interaction codes

The content of this folder are codes to Vojtech Kubac's Master Thesis.
The Thesis will be defended in Fabruary 2020 at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of 
Charles University in Prague. After successful defend the Thesis will be accessible in a 
university's repository and the link will be added to this README.

The codes are FEniCS implementation of some monolithic methods to Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).
Namely, Arbitrary-Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) - Total and Updated and Fully Eulerian.
The Fully Eulerian method (codes *Fully_Eulerian.py* and *integration_cutcell.py*) 
is not working properly by now. The ALE codes we believe work well.
The codes are customized for Turek&Hron FSI benchmark, however, modification to other
applications is straightforward (we might update the codes to more generality in the future).
