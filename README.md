Fluid-Structure Interaction codes


In each directory is a set of FEniCS codes of monolithic solvers for Fluid-Straction interaction. 
Monolithic means that they solve elastic problem and fluid problem in the same time.

These codes are related to my master thesis. 

The codes are not finished (neither is my Thesis) and some more codes will (probably) appear.
